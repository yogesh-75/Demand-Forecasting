Demand Forecasting
An AI-driven system to predict product demand for large-scale manufacturers, helping optimize inventory, pricing, and handle market uncertainty.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses Scenario-Weighted Models, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression to forecast demand based on historical sales data. The results are visualized through a Streamlit app for interactive analysis.

ðŸš€ Features
-->Scenario-weighted modeling for seasonal/market variations
-->Ensemble learning for improved accuracy
-->Baseline comparison with Linear Regression
-->Interactive Streamlit dashboard for predictions and insights

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ“Š Model Workflow
-->Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaning, encoding, and handling missing values
-->Feature Engineering â€“ Lag values, moving averages, seasonal indicators
-->Model Training â€“ Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression
-->Evaluation â€“ MAE & RMSE comparison
-->Deployment â€“ Streamlit for interactive forecasting

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Ensemble models achieved lower RMSE and MAE compared to the baseline Linear Regression, delivering more reliable forecasts.
